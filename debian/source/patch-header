The Debian packaging of farbfeld is maintained using dgit.  For the sake
of an efficient workflow, Debian modifications to the upstream
source are squashed into a single diff, rather than a series of
quilt patches.  To obtain a patch queue for package version

    % dgit clone foo
    % cd foo
    % git log --oneline 2.20170109-1..debian/2.20170109 -- . ':!debian'
