The Debian packaging of farbfeld is maintained in git, using the merging
workflow described in dgit-maint-merge(7).  There isn't a patch
queue that can be represented as a quilt series.

A detailed breakdown of the changes is available from their
canonical representation - git commits in the packaging repository.

    % git clone https://git.dgit.debian.org/farbfeld
    % cd foo
    % git log --oneline 2.20170109-1..debian/2.20170109 -- . ':!debian'

(If you have dgit, use `dgit clone foo', rather than plain `git
clone'.)

A single combined diff, containing all the changes, follows.
